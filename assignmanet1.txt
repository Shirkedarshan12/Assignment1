# Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
# Ans- A general-purpose programming language is one that?s usable (not just theoretically, but practically)
# for solving a very wide range of different kinds of problems.
# Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. Object-oriented means this language is based
# around objects (such as data) rather than functions, and high-level means it's easy for humans to understand.


# Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
# Ans-Python is both a strongly typed and a dynamically typed language.
# Strong typing means that variables do have a type and that the type matters when performing operations on a variable.
# Dynamic typing means that the type of the variable is determined only during runtime.


# Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
# Ans-The pros of Python
# 1-Python is easy to learn and read
# 2-Python enhances productivity
# 3-Python has a vast collection of libraries
# 4-Python is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community
# 5-Python is a portable programming language
# 6-Python is an interpreted language


# The cons of python programming language
# 1-Python has speed limitations
# 2-Python is not so strong with mobile computing
# 3-Python can have runtime errors
# 4-Python consumes a lot of memory space
# 5-Python is not easy to test


# Q4) In what all domains can we use Python?
# Ans-Web development,Data science,OS development,Scientific programming,Gaming



# Q5)What are variable and how can we declare them?
# Ans- A variable is the name given to memmory location in a program or we can say variable is container to store a value
# For example- a=30, b="Darshan", c=71.22



# Q6) How can we take an input from the user in Python?
# A-  name=input("Enter the name")



# Q7) What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
# A- String



# Q8) What is type casting?
# A- Type Casting is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be performed by users



# Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
# Ans- Yes we can use the raw_input ( ) or input( ) function multiple times.



# Q10. What are keywords?
#  Ans-Reserved words are present in every programming language. Be it Java or Python, each programming language has a set of reserved keywords.
# These words are also known as keywords. They convey a specific message.
# Some of the python keywords-None, Break, except, lambda, continue,class,try,true etc



# Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
# Ans-We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

# Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
# Ans-Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.



# Q13.  How can we throw some output in Python?
# Ans- We can use print statement -  print(Variable name or statement or input variable name or object)



# Q14. What are operators in Python?
#  Ans- Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.



# Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
# Ans- /' is the division operator. '//' is the integer division operator



# Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
# ```
# iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
# ```
#
# abc = ''' iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
#     '''
# print(abc)



# Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

# num=int(input("Enter a number"))

# if (num%2==0):
#     print("the number is even")
# else:
#     print("the number is odd")




# Q18. What are boolean operator?
# Ans- Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results



# Q19. What will the output of the following?
# ```
# 1 or 0

# 0 and 0

# True and False and True
# 1 or 0 or o
#
# print(1 or 0)
# print(0 and 0)
# print(True and False and True)
# print(1 or 0 or 0)



# Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
# ans-A conditional statement as the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions encountered by the program.



# Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
# Ans-It allows us to check for multiple expressions. If the condition for if is False , it checks the condition of the next elif block and so on. If all the conditions are False , the body of else is executed.



# Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

# age=int(input("Enter your age"))
# if age>=18:
#     print("I can vote")
# else:
#     print("I cant vote")



# Q23.Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
# ```
# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# numbers=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
# s=[]
# for list in numbers:
#     if list%2==0:
#         s.append(list)
# print(s)
# print(sum(s))


# Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
# num1=int(input("Enter a first number"))
# num2=int(input("Enter a second number"))
# num3=int(input("Enter a third number"))

# if num1>num2 and num1>3:
#     largenumber=num1
# elif num2>num3 and num2>num1:
#     largenumber=num2
# else:
#     largenumber=num3

# print(largenumber)




# Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

# - The number must be divisible by five

# - If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

# - If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
# ```
# numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
#
# for i in numbers:
#     if i % 5 == 0:
#         print(i)


# for i in numbers:
#     if i>150:
#         continue
#     print(i)


# for i in numbers:
#     if i>500:
#         break
#     print(i)
